# About 

```
Hands on practice with Wes Bos's js-30 course along with some own projects is being dirtied. Everything is ES6fied 
and I learned a lot of strategies for event listeners and creating very intelligent UI'S with brilliant functionalities.
At the core the main key takeaway from this repo was buiilding all the functionalities in a functional way. Took many inspirations
from the fellow course learners with their blogs and experiences on their journey.
